# react-redux-streams

An application that allows you to view a stream list, watch a stream, register and login to create, edit and delete your own streams.

For navigating around, run `yarn start` inside the client/ and api/ folders simultaneously. To add streaming with an OBS, run `yarn start` inside the rtmpserver/ folder as well.
